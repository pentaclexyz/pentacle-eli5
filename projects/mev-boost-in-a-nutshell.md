MEV-Boost is an implementation of proposer-builder separation (PBS) built by Flashbots for proof of stake Ethereum. Validators running MEV-Boost maximize their staking reward by selling blockspace to an open market of builders. It is estimated that validators running MEV-Boost can increase their staking rewards by over 60%.
