A new song, every day.

Song A Day is different from other NFT projects. It did not grow directly out of the blockchain. I had written 2000 songs before Ethereum was even invented. I wrote another 1500 before I learned about digital scarcity. But from the moment I saw CryptoPunks, I knew that Song A Day was a perfect fit.
