Balancer is a multi-token automated market maker (AMM) that functions as a self-balancing weighted portfolio protocol. Balancer is built on the Ethereum network. It allows anyone to create or add liquidity to customizable pools and earn trading fees. Compared to a typical constant product AMM model, Balancer uses a generalization formula that could be adjusted to any number of tokens at any amount of weightage.
