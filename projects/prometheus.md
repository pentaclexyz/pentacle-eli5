An open-source repository of advanced topics cutting across several languages and disciplines, founded as a public good, accessible to all and with an associated funding model that encourages contributions from developers in their educational journey, technical writers and editors, and an apprenticeship-based consultancy, whereupon selected participants will be placed into small groups, have their living expenses funded, and work together - in the open - under the guidance of a senior developer on a variety of projects, receiving task breakdowns, quality assurance and direction to boost their confidence and skillset.
