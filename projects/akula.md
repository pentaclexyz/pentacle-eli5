Speedy Ethereum archive node. Comes with faster sync speeds, crash resilience and a historical state API. 

Akula leverages multiple innovations: preprocessing data outside storage engine, staged synchronization technique and a custom optimized EVM interpreter.

All of this enables the new standard of performance, not seen in full nodes before.

Akula beats Erigon client by 1.5â€“2 times on execution performance. Without building additional indexes, a full validation of Ethereum mainnet from genesis in can be completed in under 24h.
