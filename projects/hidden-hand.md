Hidden Hand is a marketplace for governance incentives, commonly referred to as "bribes".

Protocols can leverage Hidden Hand to enable more efficient governance processes and to engage their voters, while users can earn extra yield on their favorite vote escrowed governance tokens through bribes.

All of Hidden Handâ€™s revenue is shared with rlBTRFLY holders.
