UMA features an optimistic oracle (OO) that records verifiable truths or data on the blockchain, operating in stages to verify data. This process begins with a proposed statement and includes a challenge period, dispute resolution, and finally, voting by tokenholders. UMA's OO aims to ensure honesty through economic incentives, with rare disputes due to the system's design. This setup supports various applications, including DAO governance, prediction markets, insurance, and cross-chain communication, making it a versatile tool for decentralized projects.
