Base Bridge enables the transfer of certain digital assets and other data back and forth between Ethereum and Base.

You can use popular Ethereum wallets like Coinbase Wallet, MetaMask, and Rainbow Wallet to name a few.

Transferring from Base to Ethereum takes approximately 7 days. This is a security feature designed to help secure Base. If you prefer not to wait, you can alternatively use a third-party bridge which allows you to transfer assets much faster.
