Sushi is a decentralized exchange protocol. While originally launching as a Uniswap fork, the project's community has since developed a wide range of features that make use of decentralized liquidity pools. The Kasi suite of the protocol allows people to lend and borrow tokens as well as to trade with leverage in a decentralized way, for example. The protocols native token, SUSHI, can be staked in order to claim a part of the protocol's fees.
