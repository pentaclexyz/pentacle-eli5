Uniswap is a decentralized exchange protocol. It allows people to set up or contribute to liquidity pools consisting of various ERC-20 pairs, or to use the available liquidity to swap their tokens against another using its Automated Market Maker mechanism. 

The protocol's native governance token is UNI, allowing holders to propose and vote on changes made to the Uniswap protocol.
