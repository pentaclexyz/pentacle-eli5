Vyper is a contract-oriented, pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

## Principles and Goals

Security: It should be possible and natural to build secure smart-contracts in Vyper.
Language and compiler simplicity: The language and the compiler implementation should strive to be simple.
Auditability: Vyper code should be maximally human-readable. Furthermore, it should be maximally difficult to write misleading code. Simplicity for the reader is more important than simplicity for the writer, and simplicity for readers with low prior experience with Vyper (and low prior experience with programming in general) is particularly important.
