Futureswap is a decentralized non-custodial perpetual protocol where users can gain leveraged exposure (up to 256x) to assets. Liquidity providers deposit passive liquidity in order to earn passive income from trading fees and FST incentives. This liquidity is utilized by the Futureswap AMM and other AMMs under the hood to create leveraged exposure. Realistically under the hood, Futureswap operates as a lending protocol as no leverage contracts are being created but only liquidity providers lending funds while holding collateral.
