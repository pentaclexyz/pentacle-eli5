We strongly believe that climate/ecological crisis is a symptom of a deeper underlying problem. Our neoliberal inspired socio economic structures are inherently designed to -

- Prefer short term gains for long term sustainibility
- Reward extractive business models over regenerative
- Have us perpetually addicted to toxic economic growth
- Externalize negativities while not rewarding positive externalities
- Promote material growth over well being
