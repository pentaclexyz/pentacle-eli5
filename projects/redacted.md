The Redacted ecosystem is a product suite of smart contracts empowering on-chain liquidity, governance, and cash flow for DeFi protocols. We've built two products inline with this mission: Hidden Hand and Pirex â€” with more in research and development. 

The Redacted protocol is the dApp centered around BTRFLY, which allows users to stake, earn incentives, and interact with governance proposals.

The Redacted Cartel is the DAO building out the Redacted ecosystem. The DAO consists of developers, writers, researchers, and more who are all focused on building out Redacted and extending its reach in DeFi.
