# eli5s for things on pentacle

Hello you've found the pentacle content files. 

Every night at midnight these files magically write the content on pentacle dot xyz. 

If you would like to contribute please fork the codebase, do your thing and submit a PR. 

The plan is these are written in eli5 style 
– if you follow the pattern of a short paragraph covering: `what, why, risk, reward` that would be grand. 

You can see an example here:
